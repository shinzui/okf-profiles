# transitions

Declared platform responsibility movement with TR-N handles; phase describes intent, never proves predecessor retirement.

## Guidance

Use canonical project roots and typed capability/context/flow/use-case URIs. Requirements may be absent or empty. Their environments default to all; acceptance defaults false; itemized defaults true for consumer-migration, event-obligation and responsibility-transfer, otherwise false. Responsibility-transfer is always itemized and has no responsibility field. Mori validates lowercase slugs, fixed maxAge durations, requirements[].owner role/party (a depth-two object), exactly one successor identity, to iff move, cross-list keys, retained duties, environment subsets, registry ownership and reference kinds. The profile engine cannot express these joins, forbidden conditional fields, regexes or recursive owner records. Capability status can raise caution but supplies no retirement evidence. Run mori transitions validate after strict profile enforcement.

## Settings

- OKF version: `0.2`

- Unknown concept types: rejected
- Unknown frontmatter keys: allowed
- Document ID field: `transitionId`

## Frontmatter rules

These rules apply to every concept in a bundle governed by this profile,
whatever its type. Each concept type's own page repeats them merged with that
type's rules, which is the form that actually applies.
