# jtbd-use-cases

Jobs-to-be-Done use cases connected to typed feature delivery and repository-owned improvement requests. The house `reviews` family and OKF `verified` coexist: `reviews` records far more than `verified` can, so an approving `reviews` entry should also be mirrored into `verified` to keep the derived trust tier accurate.
