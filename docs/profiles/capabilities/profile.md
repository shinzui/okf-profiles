# capabilities

Consumer-facing catalog of what a repository provides today: stable CAP-N handles, an explicit compatibility promise, and evidence. Provision claims only — absent capabilities are improvement requests, and capabilities that span repositories are use-case features owned by the consumer. The house `reviews` family and OKF `verified` coexist: `reviews` records far more than `verified` can, so an approving `reviews` entry should also be mirrored into `verified` to keep the derived trust tier accurate.

## Settings

- OKF version: `0.2`
- Required bundle version: `0.2`
- Unknown concept types: rejected
- Unknown frontmatter keys: allowed
- Document ID field: `capabilityId`

## Frontmatter rules

These rules apply to every concept in a bundle governed by this profile,
whatever its type. Each concept type's own page repeats them merged with that
type's rules, which is the form that actually applies.
