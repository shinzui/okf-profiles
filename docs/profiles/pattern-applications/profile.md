# pattern-applications

A service's reviewable decisions about which assessable catalog patterns govern it: stable PA handles, the service and pattern as canonical Mori URIs, an applicable / not-applicable / exception / needs-triage decision with rationale, service-owned check bindings, and bounded exceptions. Records applicability, never conformance.
